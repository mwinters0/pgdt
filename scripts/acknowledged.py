"""The acknowledgement register: commits that touched a figure's declared paths
without moving a reading.

**This file exists so that acknowledging a commit is not self-defeating.** The
register used to live in `measure.py`, which `session-drift` declares — so the
very commit that added an entry marked that figure stale, and no entry can name
its own sha. Chasing it with a follow-up commit moves the problem by one and
never terminates. Nothing here is on any timing path, so no figure declares
this file, and an ack-only commit now touches no measured path.

`measure.py` re-exports both names, so `measure.ACKNOWLEDGED` and
`measure.Acknowledged` still resolve.

    """One commit that touched a figure's declared paths without moving it.

    `depends` is coarse on purpose (see `SCAN` and the constants beside it),
    and coarseness costs something in *both* directions. The cost designed for
    is the false negative: a change outside the declared paths moves a figure
    and nothing says so, which is why the doc also carries a session stamp.
    This is the other one, and it is the one that decays the mechanism. A
    change *inside* a declared path that provably moves nothing leaves
    `--stale` red until a sweep re-stamps the doc — and a sweep is an hour on a
    machine that has to be quiet, so the realistic outcome is that no sweep
    runs and `--stale` becomes a light that is always on. A signal that is
    always on is the same thing as no signal, which is the decay the register
    was built against, arriving from the other side.

    So a commit can be excused, per figure, with its evidence attached.

    **Per commit, never per path.** Excusing a path would silently cover every
    future change to it, which is precisely the escape hatch that turns this
    into a way to wave away real staleness. A commit is a fixed diff that
    someone — or `--verify-additive` — actually looked at.

    **An acknowledgement lives inside one stamp's range.** Once the doc is
    re-stamped past it, the commit is no longer in any `--stale` range and the
    entry is spent; `--check` names spent entries so they are deleted rather
    than kept as sediment.
